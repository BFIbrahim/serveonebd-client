## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings

Although the frontend implementation was smooth due to prior experience, the backend introduced meaningful challenges that helped strengthen my skills.

Challenge 1: Designing Complex APIs  
As a full-stack project, creating and managing complex APIs required careful planning. By studying official documentation, exploring community forums, and testing different approaches, I improved my ability to design scalable and maintainable APIs.

Challenge 2: Implementing JWT Authentication  
Implementing JWT-based authentication required a solid understanding of token generation and verification. Reading the official JWT documentation helped me understand best practices and reinforced the importance of relying on official resources for deep technical learning.

- Improve notification and real-time update features
